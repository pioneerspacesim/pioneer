    * Asteroid terrain and colour has been tinkered with slightly, there
      is more height variation but less jagged areas too and the colours
      should consist mainly of grey and brown with some variation
      occasionally.

Alpha 6

    * More AI work (the AI can complete a full journey, taking off,
      hyperspacing, flying to destination and landing -- although the
      player can't access this since it would make the game dull, but
      NPCs will use it)
    * space stations with multiple docking ports but only one door (I
      have made one very ugly example station of this type, and welcome
      modellers to have a bash at making stations)
    * local lights for station models

Alpha 5

    * Autopilot will now fly around planets instead of plowing into them
    * Some more new ships
    * Improved error reporting for model and shader development.
    * Faster framerate in cities, particularly when shaders are enabled.
    * Fixed annoying disappearing terrain glitch
    * Reduced field of view from 90 to 83 degrees
    * Fixed random in-game crashes caused when ambient sounds are started

Alpha 4

    * Fix terrible bug (after you had looked at the bulletin board, there
      was a chance of a crash at almost any time until you leave the
      system)
    * Milkyway background in space. looks nice
    * Autopilot can now dock with space stations
    * Some new ship models
    * Various other wee fixes

Alpha 3

    * ogg vorbis sound effects supported
    * A few improvements to missing scripting
    * Some lovely new space ship models curtesy of Gernot
    * Screen resolution, shaders, sound volume and keyboard bindings are
      configurable from the game
    * Better terrain colouring (colour function gets surface normal now)
    * More sound effects from Staniol
    * Saved game file format should be forward-compatible now (but
      pre-alpha3 savefiles will not load).

Alpha 2

    * Lua missions system. The documentation on the wiki
      (http://pioneerspacesim.net/wiki) isn't 100% up-to-date and
      this needs to be worked on.
    * Much improved docking animation support.
    * Some UI improvements and mouse wheel support.
    * Ground-based starport docking sequences
    * Minor rework of shader support
    * Interface improvements and mouse wheel support
    * Wavefront obj file loader, and support for textured models
    * Police!

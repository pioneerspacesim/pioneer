    * Asteroid terrain and colour has been tinkered with slightly, there
      is more height variation but less jagged areas too and the colours
      should consist mainly of grey and brown with some variation
      occasionally.

Alpha 6

    * More AI work (the AI can complete a full journey, taking off,
      hyperspacing, flying to destination and landing -- although the
      player can't access this since it would make the game dull, but
      NPCs will use it)

      have made one very ugly example station of this type, and welcome
      modellers to have a bash at making stations)

    * Saved game file format should be forward-compatible now (but
      pre-alpha3 savefiles will not load).

Alpha 2

    * Lua missions system. The documentation on the wiki
      (http://pioneerspacesim.net/wiki) isn't 100% up-to-date and

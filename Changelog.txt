    * Bulk freight ships outside starports
    * More station backgrounds
    * Mac OS X port

    * Reworked hyperspace ranges and durations
    * Wide variation of faces in bulletin board ads
    * Combat AI will give chase if the target tries to escape

    * Hundreds of bugfixes and code cleanups

Alpha 9

  * New stuff
    * Completely rewritten autopilot. Its now far more likely to get you
      where you're going without flying into things on the way.
    * Rewritten combat AI.
    * Rewritten mouse control.
    * New combat target HUD with lead indicator and colour-coded closing
      rate.
    * New planetary terrains.
    * Identikit faces in starport screens.
    * New HUD for radar mapper and hyperspace cloud analyser.
    * Navigation computer to help you find your way around.
    * Trade ships (ie large non-combat ships) spawned when you enter a
      system.
    * Unexplored systems beyond about 500 light years from Sol.

  * Under the hood
    * All ships checked and cleaned up for consistency and speed.
    * Custom systems now defined in Lua scripts.
    * Number of planet types reduced. Planets now have composition
      attributes that define atmosphere, ground metal content, water
      coverage, etc.

  * Little things
    * Start ship is now sane.
    * Ambient light when close to a planet to make the dark side visible.
    * Mouse wheel support in scroll views.

    * Setting to enable/disable joystick support.
    * Support for building with MSVC2010.
    * Loads of bugfixes, optimisations and other bits.

Alpha 8

    * Temporal aliasing fixed so framerates above 60fps do look smoother.
    * Joystick support
    * New adverts and textures on space stations
    * Some system generation fixes
    * Red giant stars
    * New ships
    * Model viewer lets you change model by hitting escape
    * New ship definition syntax

Alpha 7

    * Planets now have Axial tilt.
    * Planetary descriptions now show the axial tilt.
    * Many planets, even habitable ones, now have some volcanoes.
    * Some planets will contain a super-volcano or two, like Mars.
    * Standard rock worlds have been reworked somewhat, terrain was
      modified as well as many new colours added.
    * Asteroid terrain and colour has been tinkered with slightly, there
      is more height variation but less jagged areas too and the colours
      should consist mainly of grey and brown with some variation
      occasionally.

Alpha 6

    * More AI work (the AI can complete a full journey, taking off,
      hyperspacing, flying to destination and landing -- although the
      player can't access this since it would make the game dull, but
      NPCs will use it)
    * space stations with multiple docking ports but only one door (I
      have made one very ugly example station of this type, and welcome
      modellers to have a bash at making stations)
    * local lights for station models

Alpha 5

    * Autopilot will now fly around planets instead of plowing into them
    * Some more new ships
    * Improved error reporting for model and shader development.
    * Faster framerate in cities, particularly when shaders are enabled.
    * Fixed annoying disappearing terrain glitch
    * Reduced field of view from 90 to 83 degrees
    * Fixed random in-game crashes caused when ambient sounds are started

Alpha 4

    * Fix terrible bug (after you had looked at the bulletin board, there
      was a chance of a crash at almost any time until you leave the
      system)
    * Milkyway background in space. looks nice
    * Autopilot can now dock with space stations
    * Some new ship models
    * Various other wee fixes

Alpha 3

    * ogg vorbis sound effects supported
    * A few improvements to missing scripting
    * Some lovely new space ship models curtesy of Gernot
    * Screen resolution, shaders, sound volume and keyboard bindings are
      configurable from the game
    * Better terrain colouring (colour function gets surface normal now)
    * More sound effects from Staniol
    * Saved game file format should be forward-compatible now (but
      pre-alpha3 savefiles will not load).

Alpha 2

    * Lua missions system. The documentation on the wiki
      (http://pioneerspacesim.net/wiki) isn't 100% up-to-date and
      this needs to be worked on.
    * Much improved docking animation support.
    * Some UI improvements and mouse wheel support.
    * Ground-based starport docking sequences
    * Minor rework of shader support
    * Interface improvements and mouse wheel support

    * Police!

      where you're going without flying into things on the way.
    * Rewritten combat AI.

      modified as well as many new colours added.
    * Asteroid terrain and colour has been tinkered with slightly, there
      is more height variation but less jagged areas too and the colours
      should consist mainly of grey and brown with some variation
      occasionally.

Alpha 6

    * More AI work (the AI can complete a full journey, taking off,
      hyperspacing, flying to destination and landing -- although the
      player can't access this since it would make the game dull, but
      NPCs will use it)
    * space stations with multiple docking ports but only one door (I
      have made one very ugly example station of this type, and welcome
      modellers to have a bash at making stations)
    * local lights for station models

    * Some more new ships

      system)
    * Milkyway background in space. looks nice
    * Autopilot can now dock with space stations

      configurable from the game
    * Better terrain colouring (colour function gets surface normal now)
    * More sound effects from Staniol
    * Saved game file format should be forward-compatible now (but
      pre-alpha3 savefiles will not load).

Alpha 2

    * Lua missions system. The documentation on the wiki
      (http://pioneerspacesim.net/wiki) isn't 100% up-to-date and
      this needs to be worked on.

    * Some UI improvements and mouse wheel support.
    * Ground-based starport docking sequences
    * Minor rework of shader support

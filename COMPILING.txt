How to compile Pioneer
======================

Pioneer is known to build on the following platforms and build systems:

Linux: GNU Autotools with GCC or Clang
Windows: Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, 2010 & 2012
Windows: GNU Autotools with MXE (MinGW GCC) (cross-compile on Linux)
OS X: GNU Autotools or XCode 4

The Autotools build system is usually the most up-to-date, and is what is used
to produce the Linux and Windows builds. The others typically lag behind,
depending on the motivation of those using them to keep them up too date with
source file changes.

There is an additional repository called pioneer-thirdparty that contains
various files that may assist with building. If the instructions for your
platforms indicates you may need it, then read the section below for details.

If you're having trouble compiling, please ask in #pioneer on
irc.freenode.net.


Linux - Autotools
-----------------

1. Install the following libraries (with development headers) for your system.
   If your system is not Debian/Ubuntu based, they may have different names.

    Debian/Ubuntu
    -------------
    g++
    automake
    pkg-config
    libsigc++-dev
    libsigc++-2.0-dev
    libsdl1.2-dev
    libsdl-image1.2-dev
    libfreetype6-dev
    libvorbis-dev
    libpng-dev
    libassimp-dev >= 3.0
    libglew-dev
    libglu1-mesa-dev
    mesa-common-dev

   If your platform doesn't have assimp 3.0, you'll need to build it from
   source. Its available in pioneer-thirdparty, see below.

2. Run ./bootstrap to generate your 'configure' file

3. Run ./configure to configure the build. If you're using the
   pioneer-thirdparty repository, pass
   --with-thirdparty=/path/to/pioneer-thirdparty to configure.

4. Run make to build everything


Windows - MSVC
--------------

1. Get both the pioneer and the pioneer-thirdparty repositories and keep them
   in a directory side by side. Don't rename pioneer-thirdparty because the
   relative path to it is included in the project files.

2. Open the pioneer solution from win32/vc2008, win32/vc2010 or vc2012 as
   appropriate for the version of Visual Studio you're using.

3. Build and run the project or solution.

Windows - Autotools (Linux cross-compile)
-----------------------------------------

1. First you need a cross-compiling environment. We use MXE (http://mxe.cc).
   The release downloads are always out of date, so grab the latest from git:

     git://github.com/mxe/mxe.git

   Now compile GCC and the dependencies needed for Pioneer:

     make gcc freetype glew sdl sdl_image vorbis libsigc++

2. Prepare the pioneer-thirdparty repository. See below.

3. Now you can build Pioneer. Run ./bootstrap to generate your 'configure'
   file.

4. Run configure to configure the build:

     ./configure --with-mxe=/path/to/mxe --with-thirdparty=/path/to/pioneer-thirdparty

5. Run make to build everything


OS X - Autotools
----------------

1. Install XCode (free download from apple). This will install the required
   compilers and other commandline tools.

2. You will need the following libraries installed. The best method I found
   was to install macports (http://www.macports.org/) and install the
   following ports (sudo port install xxxx):

     assimp
     pkgconfig
     freetype
     libsdl
     libsdl_image
     libsdl_sound
     glew
     libsigcxx2
     libvorbis
     autoconf
     automake

3. Run ./bootstrap to generate your 'configure' file

4. By default the OpenGL frameworks don't seem to be visible to 'automake'
   way so I did a few tricks to get it working:

   Create a symlink from the OpenGL framework to your /usr/local/include
   directory

     sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers/ /usr/local/include/GL

5. Instead of running ./configure run it with this command line:

     LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries -L/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework" ./configure

6. Now you can run make as per normal. :)

Note: Compiling from source this way isn't recommended as it doesn't allow you
      to 'install' the application into a different location (pioneer.app
      bundle). It also isn't the 'Apple way', To do that you need to use XCode.

OSX - XCode 4
-------------

* The XCode project isn't as up to date as the 'autotools' method and may
  be broken.

The latest XCode project files are located in ./osx. Simply build the
aplication bundle. The XCode project uses the mac port libraries that you
have installed above. Once the pioneer.app bundle is complete you can move it
around where you like (/Applications is a nice place for it).


pioneer-thirdparty
==================

The pioneer-thirdparty repository contains:
 - source for dependencies that may be difficult to obtain or build
 - pre-built dependencies for MSVC targets

To get it, clone git://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer-thirdparty.git.

Linux - Autotools
-----------------

1. After cloning the repo, run autoconf to generate 'configure'.

2. Run ./configure to configure the build

3. Run make <package> to compile and prepare the named package for use with
   Pioneer, or just run make alone to build everything.


Windows - MSVC
--------------

1. After cloning the repo, move it to a folder called "pioneer-thirdparty"
   alongside your "pioneer" folder.


Windows - Autotools (Linux cross-compile)
-----------------------------------------

1. After cloning the repo, run autoconf to generate 'configure'.

2. Run ./configure --with-mxe=/path/to/mxe to configure the build.

3. Run make <package> to compile and prepare the named package for use with
   Pioneer, or just run make alone to build everything.

OSX

- pioneer-thirdparty currently not required.

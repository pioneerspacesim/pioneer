1 How to compile Pioneer
========================

Pioneer is known to build on the following platforms and build systems:

Linux: GNU Autotools with GCC or Clang
       CMake with GCC or Clang
Windows: Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 (Community or Pro)
         Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 (Community or Pro)
         CMake with MSYS2 (and MinGW-w64)
Windows: GNU Autotools with MXE (MinGW GCC) (cross-compile on Linux)
OS X: XCode 4 or Homebrew or GNU Autotools

The Autotools build system is usually the most up-to-date, and is what is used
to produce the Linux and Windows builds. The others typically lag behind,
depending on the motivation of those using them to keep them up too date with
source file changes.

There is an additional repository called pioneer-thirdparty that contains
various files that may assist with building. If the instructions for your
platforms indicates you may need it, then read the section below for details.

If you're having trouble compiling, please ask in #pioneer on
irc.freenode.net.


1.1 Linux
---------

1. Install the following libraries (with development headers) for your system.
   If your system is not Debian/Ubuntu based, they may have different names.

    Debian/Ubuntu
    -------------
    g++
    automake
    pkg-config
    libcurl-dev
    libsigc++-dev
    libsigc++-2.0-dev
    libsdl2-dev
    libsdl2-image-dev
    libfreetype6-dev
    libvorbis-dev
    libpng-dev
    libassimp-dev >= 3.2
    mesa-common-dev

   If you are building with CMake instead of Autotools, you'll need to install
   the cmake package instead of the automake package.

   If your platform doesn't have assimp 3.2, you'll need to build it from
   source. It's available in pioneer-thirdparty, see below.

1.1.a Linux - Autotools
-----------------------

1. Run ./bootstrap to generate your 'configure' file

2. Run ./configure to configure the build. If you're using the
   pioneer-thirdparty repository, pass
   --with-thirdparty=/path/to/pioneer-thirdparty to configure.

3. Run make to build everything

1.1.b Linux - CMake
-------------------

1. Run './bootstrap cmake' to generate CMake build files in the 'build' folder.

2. Either run 'cd build; make -jX' or 'cmake --build ./build -j X', where X is
   the number of CPU cores you have. If in doubt, 4 is a good default.

3. To run pioneer, you will need to use the invocation './build/pioneer' from
   the project root. Just running ./pioneer will invoke the autotools build
   process.

1.2 Windows - MSVC
------------------

1. Get both the pioneer and the pioneer-thirdparty repositories and keep them
   in a directory side by side. Don't rename pioneer-thirdparty because the
   relative path to it is included in the project files.

2. Open the pioneer solution from /win32/vc2015/pioneer.sln
   or /win32/vc2017/pioneer.sln according to your MSVC version.

3. Build and run the project or solution. Note: the default is to build debug
   version, which is what you want if developing, but release gives an executable
   optimized for performance.

1.3 Windows - CMake and MSYS2 (and MinGW-w64)
---------------------------------------------

1. Install MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org).

2. Install MinGW-w64 from MSYS2. Use the mingw64 shell.

3. Install the dependencies (similar to dependencies of Linux) using the
   'pacman' command. Note: you should install the dependencies from the 
   MinGW-w64 repository.

4. Additionally, install GLEW.

5. Goto the root directory of Pioneer, run 'mkdir build; cd build'. Then run
   'cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SH="CMAKE_SH-NOTFOUND" -DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBGLEW=ON'
   Alternatively, these command can be run using the ./bootstrap file with
   additional arguments.

6. Compile Pioneer by running 'mingw32-make.exe'.

7. Now, you can go back to the root directory of Pioneer and do './build/pioneer.exe'
   to play the game.

1.4 Windows - Autotools (Linux cross-compile)
---------------------------------------------

1. First you need a cross-compiling environment. We use MXE (http://mxe.cc).

     git clone git://github.com/mxe/mxe.git

   Now compile GCC and the dependencies needed for Pioneer:

     make gcc freetype sdl2 sdl2_image vorbis libsigc++ assimp curl

2. Now you can build Pioneer. Run ./bootstrap to generate your 'configure'
   file.

3. Run configure to configure the build:

     ./configure --with-mxe=/path/to/mxe

4. Run make to build everything


1.5 OS X - Autotools
--------------------

1. Install XCode (free download from apple). This will install the required
   compilers and other commandline tools.

2. You will need the following libraries installed. The best method I found
   was to install macports (http://www.macports.org/) and install the
   following ports (sudo port install xxxx):

     assimp
     pkgconfig
     freetype
     libsdl2
     libsdl2_image
     libsdl2_sound
     libsigcxx2
     libvorbis
     autoconf
     automake

3. Run ./bootstrap to generate your 'configure' file

4. By default the OpenGL frameworks don't seem to be visible to 'automake'
   way so I did a few tricks to get it working:

   Create a symlink from the OpenGL framework to your /usr/local/include
   directory

     sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers/ /usr/local/include/GL

5. Instead of running ./configure run it with this command line:

     LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries -L/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework" ./configure

6. Now you can run make as per normal. :)

Note: Compiling from source this way isn't recommended as it doesn't allow you
      to 'install' the application into a different location (pioneer.app
      bundle). It also isn't the 'Apple way', To do that you need to use XCode.


1.6 OS X - Homebrew
-------------------

1. Install Homebrew package manager (http://brew.sh/) if you don't have one yet.

2. Build and install pioneer. Required dependencies will be installed together.

     brew install homebrew/games/pioneer

   Or you may want to tap homebrew-games first and then install.

     brew tap homebrew/games
     brew install pioneer

   If you want master branch from GitHub, add '--HEAD' option.

     brew install --HEAD pioneer


1.7 OS X - CMake and XCode
--------------------------

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE APPROXIMATE AND ARE UNTESTED; PLEASE SUBMIT CORRECTIONS!

1. Install XCode (free download from Apple) as in the 'OS X Autotools'
   instructions.

2. Install required libraries, as in the 'OS X Autotools' instructions.

3. Install CMake, from https://cmake.org/download/, or via MacPorts.

4. Create a new directory for the build files. Use the CMake GUI to generate
   an XCode project in the new directory.

5. Open the project in XCode and build 'pioneer'.

1.8 Nix - Autotools
-------------------

1. Install nix-shell.

2. Install and load the development environment using the included expressions.

    nix-shell nix/env.nix             # build, install and load the environment

3. Run ./bootstrap to generate your 'configure' file.

4. Run ./configure to configure the build.

5. Run make to build everything

6. Exit the development environment by exiting the shell.

Executing ./pioneer requires the development environment to be loaded,
executing ./src/pioneer does not.


2 pioneer-thirdparty
====================

The pioneer-thirdparty repository contains:
 - source for dependencies that may be difficult to obtain or build
 - pre-built dependencies for MSVC targets

To get it, clone git://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer-thirdparty.git.


2.1 Linux - Autotools
---------------------

1. After cloning the repo, run autoconf to generate 'configure'.

2. Run ./configure to configure the build

3. Run make <package> to compile and prepare the named package for use with
   Pioneer, or just run make alone to build everything.


2.2 Windows - MSVC
------------------

1. After cloning the repo, move it to a folder called "pioneer-thirdparty"
   alongside your "pioneer" folder.


2.3 Windows - Autotools (Linux cross-compile)
---------------------------------------------

1. After cloning the repo, run autoconf to generate 'configure'.

2. Run ./configure --with-mxe=/path/to/mxe to configure the build.

3. Run make <package> to compile and prepare the named package for use with
   Pioneer, or just run make alone to build everything.


2.4 OSX
-------

- pioneer-thirdparty currently not required.



3 Building documentation
========================

This section describes how to build html-documentation which is stored on disk
for the local pioneer source tree.


3.1 Lua API - Natural Docs
--------------------------

Pioneer is extensible through the Lua scripting language. It is used for
modules such as missions and BBS interaction. See the pioneer wiki for further
details. For up-to-date documentation one can build it locally from the
pioneer source

0. Install dependencies: naturaldocs

1. Run make codedoc

2. The html documentation can be found in the codedoc/ folder


3.2 C++ source - Doxygen
------------------------

To build html-documentation of the pioneer C++ source, doxygen needs to be
installed, as well as the graphviz package, from where dot is used for
visualizing inheritance as graphs. To enable LaTeX output, set GENERATE_LATEX
= YES in the configuration file doxygen/Doxyfile. Same goes for xml, man, rtf.

0. Install dependencies: doxygen and graphviz

1. Run doxygen from the doxygen/ folder.

2. The html documentation will be available from doxygen/html/index.html



4 Faster startup
================

4.1 Precompile model files
--------------------------

Long startup times for pioneer this can be alleviated by precompiling all
models into *.sgm files. This uses the modelcompiler located in src/. From the
pioneer root directory the following will batch compile all models

1. ./src/modelcompiler -b inplace

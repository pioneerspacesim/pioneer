Getting started with Pioneer
----------------------------

The principles of the game are largely the same as those of Frontier: Elite 2.

You can buy and sell on the commodities market, take missions on the bulletin
board, buy and upgrade ships in the shipyard, when docked. Do all of this with
the mouse.

The eight main console buttons are activated by the F1-F8 keys or the mouse.

F1: Change view mode (cockpit/external/sidereal)
F2: Use the map system.
F3: Look at your own information.
F4: Select targets, operate autopilot and communicate.

The view direction can be controlled, with keys:
KP 8: Front Camera / Rotate External/Sidereal Up
KP 2: Rear Camera / Rotate External/Sidereal Down
KP 4: Left Camera / Rotate External/Sidereal Left
KP 6: Right Camera / Rotate External/Sidereal Right
KP 9: Top Camera
KP 3: Bottom Camera / Roll External/Sidereal Right
KP 7: Cockpit view forward
KP 1: Cockpit view rearward / Roll External/Sidereal Left
+: Zoom in (external/sidereal view only)
-: Zoom out (external/sidereal view only)
Home: Reset zoom (sidereal view only)

(NOTE: If you do not have a numeric keypad, please rebind the view direction
controls from the View tab in the Settings screen)

The next four buttons change function depending on the first four. Hover the
mouse over them to see what they do.

F5 turns off the autopilot, and changes between manual flight and set speed
flight.

Flight controls are:
Q: Roll left
W: Pitch forward
E: Roll right
A: Yaw left
S: Pitch up
D: Yaw right
U: Ventral thruster (slide up)
I: Aft thruster (go forwards)
O: Dorsal thruster (slide down)
J: Starboard thruster (slide left)
K: Forward thruster (go backwards)
L: Port thruster (slide right)

In manual flight mode, the thrusters only fire when you tell them to.
In "set speed" mode, the autopilot tries to keep your velocity vector
in the direction that your vehicle is facing, with a constant speed.
Thruster controls still work in "set speed" mode, and override the
autopilot while you hold the thrust key down.

"Set speed" controls:
Enter: Set speed faster
RightShift: Set speed slower

You can also steer the ship with your mouse while holding the right mouse
button.

Use the cursor keys to move the camera in external and sidereal view. In
sidereal view, use ',' (comma) and '.' (period) to roll the camera in place.

To jump to another system, use the map (F2) and click on another system. Systems
with ports are labelled in blue. You need enough Hydrogen to get there, and it
must be close enough for your ship. F7 will start the hyperdrive.

To fly to a station, press F4, and select one from the right. You can turn on
the autopilot with the buttons on the left.

Trade is hard. Deliveries are fun, but can be hard. You can cheat extra money by
pressing Ctrl+M.

Press Escape while in-game (not the main menu) to open the settings screen.
Here you can change screen res/fullscreen mode, language, controls and other
things. Many options require you to restart Pioneer before they will take
effect.

Pioneer is alpha-quality software. Saved games are not guaranteed to load in
different versions of Pioneer.  The universe might not be the same in the next
version of Pioneer. Anything can change. The game is not finished, and we would
like feedback. See README.txt to find out how to do that.

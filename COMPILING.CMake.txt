HOW-TO Start building using CMake
---------------------------------

Table of contents:
1. Quick start
2. Autotools users (migration)


1. Quick start
--------------

Let's say you have source code in "SOURCE_DIR".

Prerequisites:
- Install CMake (http://cmake.org or http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
- MSVC (2008, 2010) users: Nothing more to do, dependencies are in the repository.
- Others: Install required libraries.

** Quick start, using GUI **
- Run cmake-gui.
- Source code: SOURCE_DIR
- Binaries: SOURCE_DIR/build
- Click "Configure", and select the build type you want.
- Click "Configure" until there are no more red entries.
- If there are no errors displayed, click "Generate".
- Go to SOURCE_DIR/build, and use your build system.
	- MSVC users: Simply double-click the ".sln" file.
	- Makefile-based users: run "make"

** Quick start, using command-line **
- Create and go to SOURCE_DIR/build.
- Type "cmake ..". Alternatively, you can specify a build type (Ex: "cmake -G Xcode ..")
- Go to SOURCE_DIR/build, and use your build system.
	- MSVC users: Simply double-click the ".sln" file.
	- Makefile-based users: run "make"

** Notes **
- Never modify generated makefiles, MSVC or XCode projects! These will be overwritten each time CMake needs to regenerate. Any change must be applied in the CMake scripts.
- Linux/OSX users can alternatively run "./configure.sh". This is a shortchut to "mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..".
	This may be renamed "configure" later on, to stick with common layout.
- MSVC users may need to run environment initialization batch (Generally "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio xx.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat")


2. Autotools users
------------------

If you are/were an user of "configure.ac", please read the following notes.

** Configurations **
Building a "Debug" build is not the same as using the --enable-debug option. It's more like "--enable-debug --with-no-optimise". These options have an equivalent in CMake to stick with configure.ac.

However CMake behave a bit differently. So prefer using "configurations".
To enable a given configuration for make-based builds (ie. not MSVC/XCode), you may either:
	- Enter its name in CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE (empty value defaults to "Release")
	- Invoke CMake with the appropriate option ("cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug")
Configurations are:
	- Release: optimisation (-O3 for gcc), no debug information, release build.
		Closest options: (none)
	- RelWithDebInfo: optimisation (-O2 for gcc), debug information, debug build (-DDEBUG).
		Closest options: --enable-debug
	- Debug: no optimisation, debug information, debug build (-DDEBUG).
		Closest options: --enable-debug --with-no-optimise
	- MinSizeRel: optimisation for small executable (-Os), no debug information, release build.
		Closest options: Looks much like a release (ie. no options)
Please note the RelWithDebInfo is usually *not* a debug build (-DDEBUG) within CMake. This is specific to the Pioneer project, to stick with configure.ac.

** Options equivalence table **
configure.ac             CMake variable
--with-no-optimise       Pioneer_FORCE_NO_OPTIMISE
--enable-debug           Pioneer_FORCE_DEBUG_BUILD
--with-fno-inline        Pioneer_USE_fno-inline
--with-gprof             Add "-pg" in CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS (and optionally in CMAKE_C_FLAGS)
--with-external-liblua   N/A (Doesn't exist yet)

** Other notes **
- Changing version is made by changing SET(${PROJECT_NAME}_MAJOR_VERSION ...) in CMakeLists.txt and lines following it.
- Packaging (make the "package" target for this):
	- As a .tar.bz2 (Linux): works
	- As a .zip (Windows): works
	- As an OSX DMG package: This is work-in-progress and suerly require some debugging.
	- As a Debian package: NOT ready yet in CMake scripts
	- As a Windows installer: NOT ready yet in CMake scripts

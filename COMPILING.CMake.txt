HOW-TO Start building using CMake
---------------------------------

Let's say you have source code in "SOURCE_DIR".

Prerequisites:
- Install CMake (http://cmake.org or http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
- MSVC (2008, 2010) users: Nothing more to do, dependencies are in the repository.
- Others: Install required libraries.

** Quick start, using GUI **
- Run cmake-gui.
- Source code: SOURCE_DIR
- Binaries: SOURCE_DIR/build
- Click "Configure", and select the build type you want.
- Click "Configure" until there are no more red entries.
- If there are no errors displayed, click "Generate".
- Go to SOURCE_DIR/build, and use your build system.
	- MSVC users: Simply double-click the ".sln" file.
	- Makefile-based users: run "make"

** Quick start, using command-line **
- Create and go to SOURCE_DIR/build.
- Type "cmake .."
- Go to SOURCE_DIR/build, and use your build system.
	- MSVC users: Simply double-click the ".sln" file.
	- Makefile-based users: run "make"

Notes:
	- Linux/OSX users can alternatively run ./configure as usual. This will create "build" sub-directory.
	- MSVC users may need to run environment initialization batch (Generally "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio xx.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat")

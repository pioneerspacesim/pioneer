# Source Code
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source Folder: ..\gen
   Name: C++ Lua Modules

Source Folder 2: ..\data\pigui
   Name: PiGUI Lua API

Source Folder 3: ..\data\libs
   Name: Lua Libs


# This is where you specify what files and folders Natural Docs should be
# scanning.  If you use any of these options on the command line, this entire
# section is ignored except for names and numbers.
#
# All paths are relative to the project configuration folder, which lets this
# file remain portable across computers and not cause problems in version
# control systems.  You can enter absolute paths and they will be converted
# automatically.
#
# Source Folder: [path]
#    Name: [name]
#
#    Specifies a folder which will be searched for source files.  If you have
#    more than one, add the Name property to set how it will show up in the
#    menu.


# Source Filtering
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If there are any subfolders in the source code that you would like Natural
# Docs to ignore, they can be specified here.  If you use any of these options
# on the command line, this entire section is ignored.
#
# Ignore Source Folder: [path]
#    Tells Natural Docs to skip this folder when scanning files.
#
# Ignore Source Folder Pattern: [pattern]
#    Tells Natural Docs to skip all folder names which match this pattern when
#    scanning files.  ? matches a single character, * matches zero or more
#    characters.  It applies to the entire folder name, so "cli" will not
#    match "client", although "cli*" will.
#
#    The data folders of common version control systems (.git, .svn, .cvs, .hg)
#    are ignored automatically.  You do not have to specify them here.


# Images
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is where you specify additional folders Natural Docs should look for
# images in.  When you put something like (see diagram.jpg) in a comment
# Natural Docs looks for it relative to the source file.  If you put
# additional folders here it will also check them for the image.
#
# If you use any of these options on the command line, this entire section is
# ignored except for numbers.
#
# All paths are relative to the project configuration folder, which lets this
# file remain portable across computers and not cause problems in version
# control systems.  You can enter absolute paths and they will be converted
# automatically.
#
# Image Folder: [path]
#    Specifies a folder which will be searched for image files.  They can be
#    referenced in comments with (see filename.jpg).


# Generated Documentation
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Output Folder: ..\docs\lua


# This is where you specify what kind of documentation you want Natural Docs
# to build and where it should be put.  If you use any of these options on the
# command line, this entire section is ignored except for secondary settings.
#
# All paths are relative to the project configuration folder, which lets this
# file remain portable across computers and not cause problems in version
# control systems.  You can enter absolute paths and they will be converted
# automatically.
#
# You can override any of the project information settings under each entry,
# so if you have multiple output folders you can give them each different
# styles or subtitles.
#
# HTML Output Folder: [path]
#    [Project Information]
#
#    Generates HTML documentation in the specified folder.


# Global Settings

# Other settings that apply to your entire project.  Settings specified on the
# command line override the settings here.
#
# Tab Width: [width]

#    Whether only documented code elements should appear in the output.

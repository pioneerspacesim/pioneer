#                    beneath it, like class comments.
#    end           - The comment resets the scope back to global for all the
#                    comments beneath it, like section comments.

#                    change the scope for any other comments.

#    rather than replacing them.

#    [keyword], [plural keyword]
#    ...
#    A list of keywords that only apply to the comment type when using a

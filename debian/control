Description: space adventure game, reminiscent of 'Frontier: Elite 2'
 Pioneer is a space adventure game set in the Milky Way galaxy at the turn of
 the 31st Century.
 .
 The game is open-ended, and you are free to explore the millions of star
 systems in the game. You can land on planets, slingshot past gas giants, and
 burn yourself to a crisp flying between binary star systems.
 .
 When Pioneer is finished there will be many ways to make ends meet: piracy,
 smuggling, bounty-hunting, mining, doing missions for the various factions
 fighting for power, freedom or self-determination.
 .
 Pioneer has a sneaking resemblance to Frontier: Elite 2.

History
Not much is known about the history of the Tolan Kingdom. Tolan Oberon and his descendents have ruled for over six centuries and by all acounts the citizens are happy with this. They have a strong police force but no navy. They have no interest in expanding, contacting or warring against any other peoples. They have their little slice of the galaxy and everyone seems happy enough to leave them to it. Officially. The Solar Federation is always trying to get intel out of there. the CIW mostly leaves it alone. Haber Corp has some interests, more in paying people to assasinate the King himself than anything resembling fair trade.

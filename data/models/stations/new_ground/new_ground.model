# This model is based in part on geometry and textures by "Willi Hames"
# The original mesh and textures are available from here for free:
# http://www.scifi3d.com/details.asp?intGenreID=10&intCatID=17&key=85
# 
# The original mesh required a lot of cleanup and was very high-poly for game usage
# so had to be simplified and in many cases outright deleted to get it down to budget.
# The upper and lower desking were recreated, polygon winding issues resolved and re-UV'd.
#
# New textures and materials were made by me and new geometry for the 4 lifts.

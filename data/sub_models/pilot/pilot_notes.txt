PILOT notes!

there is a wavefront .obj "dummy.obj", it's not used in the game.
but it will help modelers to determine position & scale of the pilot in the CAD software.

it's only a complete assembled (female) pilot incl. chair and centered the same as the parts in the script.
please keep it in the folder.

SCALE IS 1:1
the folder, script and models have different names to avoid conflicts with the existing pilots.

you can keep both until all ships use only this script.

the new names are easier to recall:

pilot_1 - pilot_3: 	pilots "global lit"
pilot_seat: 		common chair for a pilot
pilot_cseat: 		"comfort" version of the above
helmet_old: 		"fishbowl" type of helmet
helmet_mod: 		more modern type of helmet.

pilot_1_lit - pilot_3_lit: 	local lit pilots, used as crew on bigger ships which use a local lighting in the bridge.
pilot_seat_lit:			common chair for a pilot, locally lit
pilot_cseat_lit:		"comfort" version of the above

of course no helmets needed for crew members.

all parts are centered the same, which means a helmet simply gets placed at the same vector as the pilot or the chair.
that leaves some small differences to a female or male pilot, because the female is slightly smaller.
but due to the small size in the game you won't recognize this.

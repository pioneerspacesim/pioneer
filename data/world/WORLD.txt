	Contains patch properties for individual stations.
	Faction is the first to be loaded, then system, then both (or either) system+station files.
	Any attribute in earlier files that reoccur in later loaded files will be overridden by the
	last loaded. For example, faction values can be overridden by specific station files.

	Stations Json format:
	{
		"<PropertyName>" : {
			"value" : "<content>"
		},
		...
	}

	Properties are passed to station:setprop(<PropertyName>, <content>) for all properties
	in SpaceStation:Constructor() (libs/SpaceStation.lua).
	If PropertyName contains other keys than "value", those are ignored.
	Safe to use "comment" for example.

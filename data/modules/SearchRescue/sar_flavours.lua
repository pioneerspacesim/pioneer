-- This module defines "Search and Rescue" flavours

-- Flavour Variables
-- =================

-- Use with caution! There are checks in place but impossible combinations can still break this script.
-- An appropriate ship type will be chosen depending on the mission. Make sure a ship exists that can do
-- what is requested (i.e. has the necessary crew number).

-- id        = 1          : ID to help pull the right ad texts in

-- loctype assumptions       : a) "CLOSE" means there are stations within the system (i.e. target ships don't
--                                necessarily need hyperdrives
--                             b) "PLANET" means any target ship has to have an atmo_shield

-- loctype  = "CLOSE_PLANET" : target on the same planet the player is on (not applicable to non-ground stations)
-- loctype  = "MEDIUM_PLANET": target on a planet within the same system as the player is in
-- loctype  = "CLOSE_SPACE"  : target close to space station player is docked at - but drifting in space
-- loctype  = "FAR_SPACE"    : target in a different system - drifting in space

-- pickup_crew = 0        : how many crew members of the target ship to pick up
-- pickup_pass = 0        : how many passengers of the target ship to pick up
-- pickup_comm = {}       : type and amount of commodity to pick up from target ship

-- deliver_crew = 0       : how many crew members to deliver to target ship
-- deliver_pass = 0       : how many passengers to deliver to target ship
-- deliver_comm = {}      : type and amount of commodity to deliver to target ship

-- urgency   = 1          : factor for how urgent transport ist (most urgent time multiplied by factor)

-- reward_immediate = false : should the mission reward be provided immediately or upon return to station

-- fun_due: flavour-specific function to determine due date. Requires "dist" argument (even if not needed in function) for compatibility.

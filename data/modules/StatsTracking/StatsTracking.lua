-- Stats-gathering module. Initially, gathers kill statistics for the player.
-- Can (and should) be expanded in the future to gather other information.

-- The information gathered here is stored in the player's character sheet.
-- This is globally available to all Lua scripts. Retrieval methods should
-- be implemented as part of Characters.lua.

-- This is used for tracking which ships were damaged by the player, so that
-- we can award assists as well as kills. One day, assists might contribute to
-- the combat rating.

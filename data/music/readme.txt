Drop music files here. They must be in .ogg format, 44100 or 22050 Hz.
No music will play automatically unless there is some sort of a music
script running (in modules/).
Music can be freely organized into subdirectories (data/music/action/track01.ogg),
but again it is up to the music script what to do with the path names.

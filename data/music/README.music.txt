Music in core/ will be played by the default player script,
data/modules/MusicPlayer.lua. Mission or per-system scripts should add their
own music to a separate subdir.

Music in core/ is selected based on game events. When a particular game event
occurs a song is chosen at random from the appropriate subdir. The subdirs are
as follows:

 - space: ambient music, played while flying in space. When music for a
   specific event finishes the player will start a song from this category.
   This is also the fallback category if any category subdir has no songs in
   it.

 - near-planet, near-spacestation: ambient music specific to planets and
   orbital stations. The player will play something from one of these
   categories if ambient music is requested and the player is near a planet or
   station.

 - docked: played when the player docks (ie as the station menu appears)

 - undocked: played when the player undocks (ie when the request launch)

 - ship-nearby, ship-firing: played when the player's alert state changes
   because a ship is nearby (within 100km) or starts firing. Note that the
   presence of a ship (even a firing ship) does not necessarily mean the ship
   is hostile and the player is (about to be) in combat.

 - ship-destroyed: played with the player destroys a ship

 - player-destroyed: played when the player is destroyed. Will continue to
   play over the "tombstone" screen.

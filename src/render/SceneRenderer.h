/**
 * This file implements a high-level data-driven renderer.
 *
 * Its main concern is to render "scene" objects while providing a flexible
 * interface to manage post-processing effects, render techniques, and being
 * able to adapt to significant differences in device performance by providing
 * a built-in mechanism to control which rendering effects are executed.
 *
 * To that end, the SceneRenderer's main concern is to apply the RenderPasses
 * defined in a RenderSetup file to the objects in a scene.
 *
 * Many rendering operations are implemented as composable RenderGenerators,
 * allowing a data file to control the entire render pipe with a minimum of
 * code needing to change.
 *
 * This file is intentionally incomplete. Many planned features are not yet
 * implemented, as doing so now would introduce an unnecessarily tight coupling
 * to the Graphics::Renderer and SceneGraph APIs, which need to undergo
 * significant changes themselves.
 *
 * A short high-level TODO list follows:
 *
 * - TODO: implement conditional execution of RenderPasses
 * - TODO: split Graphics::RenderTarget into color/depth textures which can be
 *         bound together at draw time into a framebuffer object
 * - TODO: support more than one color target per render pass
 * - TODO: add a mechanism to pass additional parameters into a shader from a
 *         RenderPass section inside a RenderSetup file
 * - TODO: split responsibility for rendering lit objects into a separate
 *         Generator
 * - TODO: implement RenderObject(s) and RenderScene abstraction to separate
 *         rendering-related resources from "game code"
 * - TODO: migrate Body to create and hold a handle to RenderObject(s) rather
 *         than being responsible for directly submitting graphics API commands
 * - TODO: walk the list of active RenderObjects once and bin to individual
 *         passes rather than each pass doing an ad-hoc walk of the entire list

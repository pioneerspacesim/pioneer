/*
 * UndoStep represents a single unit of work (a single "change") made as part
 * of some user action.
 *
 * An UndoStep should store only enough state to be able to undo or redo said
 * change, as the non-transient state of the application is expected to be
 * exactly the same no matter how many times the user has undone/redone the
 * step or any other steps around it.
 *
 * Changes to transient application data (e.g. caches, derived data, etc)
 * should be triggered immediately by the UndoStep where possible to maintain
 * consistency in all areas of the application's data model.
 *
 * It is invalid for the Undo() or Redo() methods to directly or indirectly
 * create a new UndoEntry or UndoStep while being executed, as this will
 * corrupt the undo manager's state.

/*
 * The UndoSystem provides a central place to manage undo entries for a
 * specific "undo queue" (e.g. document, window, editor, etc).
 *
 * It maintains separate undo/redo stacks under the hood, and allows for
 * recursion of entries to allow maximum flexibility in calling code.
 *
 * Recursive BeginEntry() calls must be matched with EndEntry() calls, and the
 * name of sub-entries is lost. Undo operates on the granularity of top-level
 * UndoEntries, so sub-entries only allow composing program operations that
 * would otherwise require multiple undo interactions for a single user action.
 *
 * AddUndoStep() creates a new undo step and adds it to the currently active
 * UndoEntry. The Redo method of the undo entry is not triggered automatically,
 * as the semantics of an UndoStep are simpler without the Undo/Do/Redo split.
 *
 * Calling BeginEntry() / ResetEntry() / EndEntry() / AddUndoStep() while an
 * UndoEntry is being undone or redone is a violation of program state and will
 * cause a crash.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * A common pattern is to begin an UndoEntry when the user signals they want
 * to begin editing (e.g. user clicks on a transform handle) and update that
 * entry while the user performs some continuous action (such as dragging).
 *
 * There are two options to achieve this pattern: if your UndoSteps store only
 * the "prior state" of the application, you can call BeginEntry() once, submit
 * one or more UndoSteps, and modify application state as needed over multiple
 * frames before calling EndEntry().
 *
 * Alternatively, if your undo steps must know both the prior and current state
 * of the application, you can call ResetEntry() each frame to undo and discard
 * all submitted UndoSteps() in the currently active entry. All submitted steps
 * will be undone, regardless of BeginEntry() recursion level.

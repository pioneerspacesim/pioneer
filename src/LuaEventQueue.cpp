/*
 * Class: EventQueue
 *
 * A class to manage a queue of events.
 *
 * The majority of the work done by a Pioneer Lua module is in response to
 * events. The typical structure of a module will be to define a number of
 * event handler functions and then register them with the appropriate event
 * queues.
 *
 * When particular events occur within the game, such as a ship docking or the
 * player coming under attack, the appropriate <EventQueue> object is
 * triggered. This causes all functions registered with the event queue to be
 * called, in no particular order.
 *
 * An event usually has one or more parameters attached to it that describe
 * the details of the event. For example, the <onShipDocked> event has two
 * parameters, the <Ship> that docked, and the <SpaceStation> it docked with.
 *
 * Many of these events are triggered as a result of something happening to a
 * <Ship>. The same events are used when something happens to a <Player>
 * (which is also a <Ship>). Call the <Ship.IsPlayer> method on the <Ship> if
 * your module needs to know the difference.
 *
 * The <EventQueue> objects are available under the global EventQueue
 * namespace.
 *
 *
 * Event: onGameStart
 *
 * Triggered when the game is first initialised.
 *
 * > local onGameStart = function () ... end
 * > EventQueue.onGameStart:Connect(onGameStart)
 *
 * onGameStart is triggered just after the physics <Body> objects (including
 * the <Player>) are placed.
 *
 * This is a good place to add equipment to the Player ship or spawn objects
 * in the space. You should also initialise your module data for the game
 * here.
 *
 * Availability:
 *
 *   alpha 10
 *
 * Status:
 *
 *   stable
 *
 *
 * Event: onGameEnd
 *
 * Triggered when game is finished.
 *
 * > local onGameEnd = function () ... end
 * > EventQueue.onGameEnd:Connect(onGameEnd)
 *
 * Triggered just before the physics <Body> objects (include the <Player>) are
 * destroyed and Pioneer returns to the main menu.
 *
 * You should clean up any game data here. Remember that your module will be
 * re-used if the player begins another game. You probably don't want any data
 * from a previous game to leak into a new one.
 *
 * Availability:
 *
 *   alpha 10
 *
 * Status:
 *
 *   stable
 *
 *
 * Event: onEnterSystem
 *
 * Triggered when a ship enters a system after hyperspace.
 *
 * > local onEnterSystem = function (ship) ... end
 * > EventQueue.onEnterSystem:Connect(onEnterSystem)
 *
 * This is the place to spawn pirates and other attack ships to give the
 * illusion that the ship was followed through hyperspace.
 *
 * Note that this event is *not* triggered at game start.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   ship - the <Ship> that entered the system
 *
 * Availability:
 *
 *   alpha 10
 *
 * Status:
 *
 *   stable
 *
 *
 * Event: onLeaveSystem
 *
 * Triggered immediately before ship leaves a system and enters hyperspace.
 *
 * > local onLeaveSystem = function (ship) ... end
 * > EventQueue.onLeaveSystem:Connect(onLeaveSystem)
 *
 * If the ship was the player then all physics <Body> objects are invalid after
 * this method returns.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   ship - the <Ship> that left the system
 *
 * Availability:
 *
 *   alpha 10
 *
 * Status:
 *
 *   stable
 *
 *
 * Event: onFrameChanged
 *
 * Triggered as a dynamic <Body> moves between frames of reference.
 *
 * > local onFrameChanged = function (body) ... end
 * > EventQueue.onFrameChanged:Connect(onFrameChanged)
 *
 * Details of the new frame itself can be obtained from the body's
 * <Body.frameBody> and <Body.frameRotating> attributes.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   body - the dynamic <Body> that changed frames
 *
 * Availability:
 *
 *   alpha 12
 *
 * Status:
 *
 *   experimental
 *
 *
 * Event: onShipDestroyed
 *
 * Triggered when a ship is destroyed.
 *
 * > local onShipDestroyed = function (ship, attacker) ... end
 * > EventQueue.onShipDestroyed:Connect(onShipDestroyed)
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   ship - the ship that was destroyed
 *
 *   attacker - the <Body> that was responsible for reducing the ship's hull
 *   strength to 0. Usually a ship that fired lasers or missiles, but may be
 *   another <Body> (eg <Planet> or <SpaceStation>) if the ship was destroyed
 *   by a collision.
 *
 * Availability:
 *
 *   alpha 10
 *
 * Status:
 *

 *
 *
 * Event: onShipHit
 *
 * Triggered when a ship is hit by laser fire or a missile.
 *
 * > local onShipHit = function (ship, attacker) ... end
 * > EventQueue.onShipHit:Connect(onShipHit)
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   ship - the <Ship> that was hit
 *
 *   attacker - the <Ship> that fired the laser or missile
 *
 * Availability:
 *
 *   alpha 10
 *
 * Status:

 *
 *
 * Event: onShipCollided
 *
 * Triggered when a ship collides with an object.
 *
 * > local onShipCollided = function (ship, other) ... end
 * > EventQueue.onShipCollided:Connect(onShipCollided)
 *
 * If the ship collides with a city building on a planet it will register as
 * as collision with the planet itself.
 *
 * If the ship "collides" with a missile, <onShipHit> will be triggered
 * instead of <onShipCollided>.
 *
 * If the ship hit another <Ship>, this event will be triggered twice, once
 * for each ship.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   ship - the <Ship> that was hit
 *
 *   other - the <Body> that the ship collided with
 *
 * Availability:

 * <SpaceStation.AddAdvert> and <SpaceStation.RemoveAdvert> to update the
 * bulletin board.
 *
 * This event is triggered at a random game time 1-2 hours after it was
 * previously called. This period is subject to change; script authors should
 * not rely on it.
 *
 * <onUpdateBB> will never be triggered for a station that has not previously
 * had <onCreateBB> triggered for it.
 *

 *
 *   station - the <SpaceStation> the bulletin board is being updated for

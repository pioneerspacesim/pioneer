// Andrew Copland (2016/03/10 )This is a port of a port! Done under the MIT license (see ^^^Above^^^).
// Originally pointed out to me by RobN in a forum thread (http://pioneerspacesim.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=221)
// I was deterred by A) not knowing any javascript, B) the more I saw of it the more I hated it.
// Then I noticed the C# port by Nathan Jones (https://github.com/nathanpjones/randomColorSharped) which was a much more logical starting point.
// I have included a snippet of his readme below about how he himself came to port it.

//randomColorSharped
//==================
//
// This is a port to c# (.NET 4.0) of [randomColor](http://llllll.li/randomColor/), David Merfield's javascript random color generator. 
// This was ported by [Nathan Jones](http://www.nathanpjones.com/) so that users of the .NET family of languages could enjoy these attractive colors.
// 
// I saw this project linked on [Scott Hanselman's](http://www.hanselman.com/) excellent [Newsletter of Wonderful Things](http://www.hanselman.com/newsletter/) 
// around the same time a coworker was creating an ad hoc visualization app. As we watched the data appear on screen, we had to squint as some of the colors 
// were very difficult to make out against the background. This should make things easier to see and will hopefully help others as well.

* These classes contain descriptions of atmospheres relevant to:
*     1. Gameplay:  scooping for fuel /oxygen, habitation worlds, 
*                   faction expansion/worth of worlds, protection 
*                   from sight/certain scanning frequencies by aerosol
*     2. Rendering: atmosphere colour, sunsets/sunrises, 
*                   aerosol layers, distribution of scatterers
*     3. Physics:   variation in density/drag/buoyancy, pressure, temperature.
*
*
* SystemBody, Terrain, and sysgen concerns:
*                 1. Pioneer requires data to be generated about systems the player is not in.
*                    Trade/pirate/military/economy AI, sector view screen, faction behaviour, mission generation etc.
*                        1.1 Different levels of details for different purposes.
*                 2. Sysgen uses number sequences with very long state (seeds) internally. 
*                    Common int32 body seed only allows for 4bn possibilities. 
*                    There are much greater than 4bn stars in the galaxy alone.
*                       2.1 Preferable to use the properly seeded and large number sequences in the main sysgen
*                           to generate some of the important parameters e.g. atmosOxidizing.
*                 3. The best option seems to be to do generation in stages. In the eventuality sysgen 
*                    needs some detailed atmosphere data, it's possible to generate it in 
*                    reverse - the gameplay consequences first and derive properties from that.
*                 4. Atmospheres should depend on terrain classes. Part of the terrain property gen now in Terrain:: could be moved to another class.
*                 5. One option is a second AtmosphereBody class which 
*                    houses the later stages of physics/rendering and generates verticies etc.
*
* Class boundaries/division philosophy: 
* (As things currently stand. This will change as functionality requirements with advanced scattering etc. 
  become clear and this will be updated.)
* Succinctly: Atmosphere:
*                 1. Atmospheres contain lists of constituents. 
*                        1.1 The constituents can be aersols or gasses.
*                 2. Atmosphere class is responsible for:
*                        2.1 Creating descriptions of the atmosphere including 
*                            the constituents.
*                        2.2 Calculating all the quantities needed for gameplay, physics 
*                            and rendering from the constituents.
*                                2.21 e.g. Scale height(s), Overall particle density, 
*                                     average scattering coefficient etc.
*                        2.3 Interfaces for relevant functions
*                                2.31 e.g. to check if a particular element or gas is present 
*                                or calculate concentration.
*             Constituents:
*                  3. Constituents contain a description of the role an aerosol or gas 
*                     plays in the atmosphere. 
*                          3.1 e.g. the fraction of the atmosphere composed
*                               of a constituent or the scale height of an aerosol
*                  4. Constituent classes contain links to the constant classes 
*                     describing Gas/Aerosol properties.
*             Gas and Aerosol static const objects:
*                  5. Contain relevant properties, and chemical composition as lists of substances
*                     if applicable.
*             Substance static const objects:
*                 6. Contains descriptions of elements (e.g. H or O) and substances with a
*                    chemical formula (e.g. water H2O). Substances 
*                 7. The idea is to make adding new substances with different chemical 
*                    compositions easy.
*                 8. Will also be used for other things like planet resources/minerals/mining/ eventually.
*
* Background Info (Eventually:).. this should contain enough information for a new contributior to make a start 
* and improve things. Also someone unfamiliar to should be able to reasonably quickly check specific functionality/confirm something 
* without having to learn everything.) 
* (It just contains stuff related to related to rendering)
* Atmospheres contain scatterers (particles). These can be Aerosols or Gas molecules.
* Scatteres can bounce (and also absorb) light particles affecting what is seen.
* Scattering depends on the particle density rather than mass density. 
* i.e. the same number of light particles with similar scattering characteristics
* in a volume will affect light as much as the same number of lighter particles with similar scattering properties.
* **This means we need to deal with the particle density rather than the fractions of the mass
* In point form:
* Aerosols: Large particles (>1 micrometer) compared visible light wavelengths  
*           (=400-700 nanometers).'Mie scattering' in scattering models/shaders.
*           Can absorb light. e.g. Dust and other particulate matter 
*           (e.g. from volcanism) as well as man made pollutants 
*           smog, smoke, particles from massive explosions etc. Aerosols are important 
*           in that they make otherwise colourless atmospheres interesting (e.g. Mars)
*           Each type can have different distribution (different scale height).
*           
*
* Gasses: Molecules much smaller than the wave lengths of visible light. 
*         Subject to 'Rayliegh scattering' in models/shaders.
*         Made up of multiple elements with a chemical formula. e.g. CH4 ==> methane.
*         Are usually well mixed to a great degree - i.e. retain constant proportions (same scale height gasses).
*         in most scattering models. Do not absorb light. Note: Trace amounts of exotic gasses/aerosols
*         give gas giants a lot of colour.

* ElementComposition:  Properties needed to derive game relevant quantities such as the concentration of a 
*                      particular element in a gas, for scooping.
* ChemicalComposition: Chemical composition of a substance i.e. it's chemical formula. Relevant properties of that substance.

/*
 To do 
    Add rayleigh and mie coefficients for various gasses
    Expose gas/aerosol consituents in atmospheres to Lua
    Expose values such as isothermal scale height and adiabatic limit (useful for player/autopilot)
    Translations of strings
    Absorption coefficients for aerosol?
	Split content into more files
	Expose presence of gasses, corrosiveness, or certain elements in compounds to Lua 

Enable chemical compositions:
    Add chemical formula names
    Add elements and enable substances
    Add chemical compositions to gasses, and maybe aerosols

Advanced atmosphere structure:
    Multiple scale heights? there could be a few aerosol layers with their own scale height

Advanced scattering values:
    Isothermal thickness of atmosphere if the density were uniform (integrate and divide by surface density)
    Investigate refractive index variation with gas composition
*

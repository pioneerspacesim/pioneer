				How to Compile pioneer under OSX
				================================

This is some quick and dirty instructions on how to get pioneer working under
OSX. 

The GNU Way...:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. You will need the following libraries installed. The best method I found
   was to install macports (http://www.macports.org/) and install the
   following:

	pkgconfig
	freetype
	libsdl
	libsdl_image
	libsdl_sound
	glew
	libsigcxx2

2. Run ./bootstrap.sh to generate your 'configure' file

3. By default the OpenGL frameworks don't seem to be visible the 'automake'
   way so I did a few tricks to get it working:

   Create a symlink from the OpenGL framework to your /usr/local/include 
   directory

	     sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers/ /usr/local/include/GL
 
4. Instead of running ./configure run it with this command line:

		LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries -L/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework" ./configure

5. Now you can run Make as per normal. :)

Using XCode: (using v4.x)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is currently an Xcode project located in the ./osx directory. This is
the project setup that I currently use, and it has not been tested on a
different system. I have already setup the paths and project settings based
on the libraries and headers already setup the 'GNU way' as stated above. 
This saves many #ifdef's that would have to be riddled through the code just
because of Xcode.
